INSTALLATION

If you are running the application in a *nix environment, some files and directories need write permissions. You can either run the install.bash script located in this directory, or you can give the following files write permissions yourself:

In order to install the application, simply access it from a browser, through your webserver, and it will provide you with means of installation.
